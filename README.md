# Beginner's Series - Intro to JavaScript (Node.js)

## Overview

We created a video series to aid the [burgeoning](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/burgeoning) developer curious about writing [JavaScript](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Our goal is to help show you enough JavaScript to give you the background needed to begin working through quick starts and tutorials focused on frameworks and [SDKs](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit) using JavaScript.

It is assumed you have experience with a programming language such as Python, Java or C#, and are familiar with core concepts such as boolean logic, functions and variables. We focus on the syntax, but not the theory; we show you how to perform the tasks you've done before in JavaScript.

We use Node.js as the runtime instead of the browser. While almost all of the code we use works in both locations, all demos will be executed from the console using Node.js.

## Next steps

Because our goal is to help get you ready for quick starts and tutorials, here's a great collection of resources you can use to continue to build your knowledge.
